***Download Manager**

Java application that simulates a download manager capable of downloading multiple files concurrently.
The application should:

1. Accept a list of URLs as input from the user.
2. Create a separate thread for each URL to download the corresponding file.
3. Implement a progress bar for each download to provide feedback to the user.
4. Handle potential errors that may occur during the download process (e.g., network issues, invalid URLs).
5. Demonstrate thread synchronization to ensure safe access to shared resources (e.g., a data structure to store downloaded files).

This project will allow you to explore concepts of
    thread creation,
    thread management,
    synchronization, and
     exception handling in a practical scenario.

You can experiment with different techniques for improving download efficiency and responsiveness using multiple threads.
